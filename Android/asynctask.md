/**
 * <p>AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. This class allows you
 * to perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread without
 * having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.</p>
 *
 * <p>AsyncTask is designed to be a helper class around {@link Thread} and {@link Handler}
 * and does not constitute a generic threading framework. AsyncTasks should ideally be
 * used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.) If you need to keep threads
 * running for long periods of time, it is highly recommended you use the various APIs
 * provided by the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package such as {@link Executor},
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} and {@link FutureTask}.</p>
 *
 * <p>An asynchronous task is defined by a computation that runs on a background thread and
 * whose result is published on the UI thread. An asynchronous task is defined by 3 generic
 * types, called <code>Params</code>, <code>Progress</code> and <code>Result</code>,
 * and 4 steps, called <code>onPreExecute</code>, <code>doInBackground</code>,
 * <code>onProgressUpdate</code> and <code>onPostExecute</code>.</p>

 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>AsyncTask must be subclassed to be used. The subclass will override at least
 * one method ({@link #doInBackground}), and most often will override a
 * second one ({@link #onPostExecute}.)</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of subclassing:</p>
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * private class DownloadFilesTask extends AsyncTask&lt;URL, Integer, Long&gt; {
 *     protected Long doInBackground(URL... urls) {
 *         int count = urls.length;
 *         long totalSize = 0;
 *         for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
 *             totalSize += Downloader.downloadFile(urls[i]);
 *             publishProgress((int) ((i / (float) count) * 100));
 *             // Escape early if cancel() is called
 *             if (isCancelled()) break;
 *         }
 *         return totalSize;
 *     }
 *
 *     protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... progress) {
 *         setProgressPercent(progress[0]);
 *     }
 *
 *     protected void onPostExecute(Long result) {
 *         showDialog("Downloaded " + result + " bytes");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Once created, a task is executed very simply:</p>
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * new DownloadFilesTask().execute(url1, url2, url3);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>AsyncTask's generic types</h2>
 * <p>The three types used by an asynchronous task are the following:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li><code>Params</code>, the type of the parameters sent to the task upon
 *     execution.</li>
 *     <li><code>Progress</code>, the type of the progress units published during
 *     the background computation.</li>
 *     <li><code>Result</code>, the type of the result of the background
 *     computation.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Not all types are always used by an asynchronous task. To mark a type as unused,
 * simply use the type {@link Void}:</p>
 * <pre>
 * private class MyTask extends AsyncTask&lt;Void, Void, Void&gt; { ... }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>The 4 steps</h2>
 * <p>When an asynchronous task is executed, the task goes through 4 steps:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link #onPreExecute()}, invoked on the UI thread before the task
 *     is executed. This step is normally used to setup the task, for instance by
 *     showing a progress bar in the user interface.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #doInBackground}, invoked on the background thread
 *     immediately after {@link #onPreExecute()} finishes executing. This step is used
 *     to perform background computation that can take a long time. The parameters
 *     of the asynchronous task are passed to this step. The result of the computation must
 *     be returned by this step and will be passed back to the last step. This step
 *     can also use {@link #publishProgress} to publish one or more units
 *     of progress. These values are published on the UI thread, in the
 *     {@link #onProgressUpdate} step.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #onProgressUpdate}, invoked on the UI thread after a
 *     call to {@link #publishProgress}. The timing of the execution is
 *     undefined. This method is used to display any form of progress in the user
 *     interface while the background computation is still executing. For instance,
 *     it can be used to animate a progress bar or show logs in a text field.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #onPostExecute}, invoked on the UI thread after the background
 *     computation finishes. The result of the background computation is passed to
 *     this step as a parameter.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <h2>Cancelling a task</h2>
 * <p>A task can be cancelled at any time by invoking {@link #cancel(boolean)}. Invoking
 * this method will cause subsequent calls to {@link #isCancelled()} to return true.
 * After invoking this method, {@link #onCancelled(Object)}, instead of
 * {@link #onPostExecute(Object)} will be invoked after {@link #doInBackground(Object[])}
 * returns. To ensure that a task is cancelled as quickly as possible, you should always
 * check the return value of {@link #isCancelled()} periodically from
 * {@link #doInBackground(Object[])}, if possible (inside a loop for instance.)</p>
 *
 * <h2>Threading rules</h2>
 * <p>There are a few threading rules that must be followed for this class to
 * work properly:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The AsyncTask class must be loaded on the UI thread. This is done
 *     automatically as of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN}.</li>
 *     <li>The task instance must be created on the UI thread.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #execute} must be invoked on the UI thread.</li>
 *     <li>Do not call {@link #onPreExecute()}, {@link #onPostExecute},
 *     {@link #doInBackground}, {@link #onProgressUpdate} manually.</li>
 *     <li>The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if
 *     a second execution is attempted.)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Memory observability</h2>
 * <p>AsyncTask guarantees that all callback calls are synchronized to ensure the following
 * without explicit synchronizations.</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The memory effects of {@link #onPreExecute}, and anything else
 *     executed before the call to {@link #execute}, including the construction
 *     of the AsyncTask object, are visible to {@link #doInBackground}.
 *     <li>The memory effects of {@link #doInBackground} are visible to
 *     {@link #onPostExecute}.
 *     <li>Any memory effects of {@link #doInBackground} preceding a call
 *     to {@link #publishProgress} are visible to the corresponding
 *     {@link #onProgressUpdate} call. (But {@link #doInBackground} continues to
 *     run, and care needs to be taken that later updates in {@link #doInBackground}
 *     do not interfere with an in-progress {@link #onProgressUpdate} call.)
 *     <li>Any memory effects preceding a call to {@link #cancel} are visible
 *     after a call to {@link #isCancelled} that returns true as a result, or
 *     during and after a resulting call to {@link #onCancelled}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Order of execution</h2>
 * <p>When first introduced, AsyncTasks were executed serially on a single background
 * thread. Starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#DONUT}, this was changed
 * to a pool of threads allowing multiple tasks to operate in parallel. Starting with
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}, tasks are executed on a single
 * thread to avoid common application errors caused by parallel execution.</p>
 * <p>If you truly want parallel execution, you can invoke
 * {@link #executeOnExecutor(java.util.concurrent.Executor, Object[])} with
 * {@link #THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR}.</p>
