**What is level of abstraction in programming?**
The amount of complexity by which a system is viewed or programmed. The higher the level, the less detail. The lower the level, the more detail. The highest level of abstraction is the entire system. The next level would be a handful of components, and so on, while the lowest level could be millions of objects.There are mainly three levels of data abstraction:

    Internal Level: Actual PHYSICAL storage structure and access paths.
    Conceptual or Logical Level: Structure and constraints for the entire database.
    External or View level: Describes various user views.

**Why would you create an abstract class?**
The short answer: An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it. And whereas a class can extend only one abstract class, it can take advantage of multiple interfaces.

**Why is abstraction needed?**
Why Abstraction is Really Important. Abstraction is one of the key elements of good software design. It helps encapsulate behavior. ... When developing with higher level of abstraction, you communicate the behavior and less the implementation.
